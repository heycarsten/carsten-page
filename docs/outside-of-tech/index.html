<p>I have a lot of other interests outside of software and related technologies. Above all I enjoy spending time with my family and my friends, sharing stories, discussing topics; just existing together.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m a cyclist. I ride on-road, off-road, and track. I ride socially for fun, for fitness, to commute, to challenge myself, to connect with the natural world, and sometimes to reconnect with myself. I belong to <a href="https://instagram.com/cascade_cycling">Cascade Cycling</a>, a grassroots cycling club some friends found, we hang out at <a href="https://instagram.com/grupettolife">Grupetto</a> a lotâ€¦ itâ€™s maybe kind of a problem ðŸ¤ª</p>
<p>Iâ€™m a motorist. I love vehicles, I enjoy driving, Iâ€™m excited by the auto industry. I think electric vehicles are the future, and I think tractor pulls are a part of that future too. I love tinkering with automobiles, I restored and customized a 1989 Chevrolet S-10 in the early 2000s. It was one of the most resonating learning experiences Iâ€™ve had in my life, and it demystified so many things.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m a cook. Food is important to me, it nourishes me, it excites me, it comforts me, relaxes me. Food connects me to people, memories, cultures, and places. Erin does 95% of the cooking in our household, sheâ€™s one of the best cooks I know. We love to host parties and share our food and drink with all who can come.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m an outdoorsman. I find gardening very satisfying. Hiking through the Dundas Valley, seeing interesting plants and mushrooms growing. Observing all of the different cycles of plants, animals, and insects throughout the year. Iâ€™m very interested in trees, they fascinate me with their mycorrhizal networks and defense systems. In another life I totally might have been an arborist. Iâ€™ve never hunted, but Iâ€™d be curious to observe an experienced hunter one day.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m an artist. I think we all are. I love music of many forms: techno, jazz, metal, punk, hardcore, dancehall, hip hop, classical. I enjoy visual art, and design of many styles and tastes. I am fascinated by all of the different ways we can communicate our emotions, intentions, fears, joys through these mediums, often with great clarity.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m an activist. When I am distrusting of someone or something, I am honest and open about it. I donâ€™t see life as a competition to be solely won, I see it as a series of interconnected mutually beneficial goals to be achieved. When I observe injustice, evil, or cruelty: I call it out! I support indigenous rights, human rights, I support women, I support the marginalized.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m a father and husband. First and foremost, it is what matters most to me; the health and safety of my family. (That rhymes, see, told you Iâ€™m an artist ðŸ˜‰)</p>
