Hi, I'm Carsten 👋🏼

I'm a lead software developer specializing in web applications and related technologies and systems. I'm all about collaboration, I try to be as open and honest about what I don't know as I can be. I wasn't always like that, but as soon as I stopped my world started expanding at a rate that still shocks me! I am a curious human and I love to learn and connect with people. 🙂
