# Me Outside of Tech

I have a lot of other interests outside of software and related technologies. Above all I enjoy spending time with my family and my friends, sharing stories, discussing topics; just existing together.

Iâ€™m [a cyclist](https://www.strava.com/athletes/heycarsten). I ride on-road, off-road, and track. I ride socially for fun, for fitness, to commute, to challenge myself, to connect with the natural world, and sometimes to reconnect with myself. I belong to [Cascade Cycling](https://instagram.com/cascade_cycling), a grassroots cycling club some friends and I founded, we hang out at [Grupetto](https://instagram.com/grupettolife) a lotâ€¦ itâ€™s maybe kind of a problem. ðŸ˜‚

Iâ€™m a motorist. I love vehicles, I truly enjoy driving and Iâ€™m excited by the auto industry. I think electric vehicles and renewable energy sources are the future. I also think that tractor pulls and drifting competitions are a part of that future too! I love tinkering with automobiles, I restored and customized a [1989 Chevrolet S-10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEjBxQg2AOg) in the early 2000s. It was one of the most resonating learning experiences Iâ€™ve had in my life, and it demystified so many things for me.

Iâ€™m a [cook](https://www.instagram.com/p/iZZOc2AeTe/). Food is important to me, it [humours](https://www.instagram.com/p/yezN3UAeex/) me, it [excites](https://www.instagram.com/p/BIKnN4ehPlE/) me, it [comforts](https://www.instagram.com/p/n88CLWgeb3/) me, [relaxes](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXIn_86lcv-/) me. Food [connects me to people](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bh9dZ8inlOz/), memories, cultures, and places. Erin does 95% of the cooking in our household, sheâ€™s one of the best cooks I know. We love to host parties and share our food and drink with all who can come.

Iâ€™m an outdoorsman. I find gardening very satisfying. Hiking through the Dundas Valley, seeing [interesting plants and mushrooms](https://www.instagram.com/p/BpUimPVHoaR/) growing. Observing all of the different cycles of plants, animals, and insects throughout the year. Iâ€™m very interested in trees, they fascinate me with their [mycorrhizal networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal_network) and [defense systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juglone). In another life I totally might have been an arborist. Iâ€™ve never hunted, but Iâ€™d be curious to observe an experienced hunter one day.

Iâ€™m an artist. I think we all are. I love [music](https://soundcloud.com/weirderness) of many forms: techno, jazz, metal, punk, hardcore, dancehall, hip hop, classical, etc. I enjoy visual art, and design of many styles and tastes. I am fascinated by all of the different ways we can communicate our emotions, intentions, fears, joys through these mediums, often with great clarity.

Iâ€™m an activist. When I am distrusting of someone or something, I am honest and open about it. I donâ€™t see life as a competition to be solely won, I see it as a series of interconnected mutually beneficial goals to be achieved. When I observe injustice, evil, or cruelty: I call it out! I support [indigenous rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_rights), [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights), I support [women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman), I support the [socially excluded and marginalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion).

Iâ€™m a husband to Erin, and a father to Rosa. I'm an active member of my community, [Dundas, Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundas,_Ontario) and [Hamilton, Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario). It is very important to me that I understand the needs of the people, places, and businesses where I live and do whatever I can to help them, and support them. I invest in my community in whatever ways I can, mostly with my time but also financially when possible. This matters to me, Erin, and my friends too.
